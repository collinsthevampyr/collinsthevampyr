Snort IDS Project Documentation

Requirements
- A network to install Snort
- A machine on the same network to simulate a vulnerable machine
- Another machine on a different network to simulate an attacker or external machine
In this setup, I utilized a Kali Linux machine and Metasploitable 2 to simulate the host network and vulnerable machine for Snort installation. Additionally, I used Ubuntu as the attacker machine to simulate the attack.

- Project Outline
I installed Snort, configured Snort rules, and created custom rules using Snorpy to enhance the Snort IDS.

- Setting Up Snort on a Local Network
Install Snort:

- Command: sudo apt-get install snort -y
During installation, specify the network for Snort and the IP range it should monitor.
Verify Installation:

- Check if Snort is installed by running snort -V in the terminal.
Enable Promiscuous Mode:

- Ensure promiscuous mode is enabled on the network interface.
Configure Snort:

- Snortâ€™s configuration file is located in the /etc/snort directory.
The rules are saved in the rules directory.
The primary configuration file is snort.conf in the /etc/snort directory.
Make a backup of snort.conf before editing.
Edit the configuration file with sudo privileges using your preferred editor (vim or nano).
Set Network Variables:

- Locate the ipvar HOME_NET line and specify the subnet you want Snort to monitor.
Leave the EXTERNAL_NET variable as any to monitor attacks from any network.
Critical Infrastructure Monitoring:

- Specify critical infrastructure (e.g., DNS_SERVERS, SMTP_SERVERS, SQL_SERVERS) for Snort to monitor.
Specify Rules Path:

- Define the path to your rules file in the configuration.
Custom Rules:

- The local.rules file is where custom rules are stored. This file is initially empty.
Test Configuration:

- Run sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf to test the configuration file.
Disable Default Rules:

- Edit the configuration file to comment out default rules using the # symbol.
Use vim to show line numbers for easier editing.
Create Custom Rules:

- Example rule to detect ICMP pings:
bash
Copy code
alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"New ICMP Ping Detected"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
This rule alerts on any ICMP ping from any IP and any port to the home network.
Run Snort in Alert Mode:

- Command: sudo snort -q -l /var/log/snort -i enp0s3 -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
Test Snort:

- Ping the network with Snort installed from an external machine to verify the alert rule.
Monitor SSH Connections:

- Create a new rule in the local.rules file to monitor for SSH connections.
By following these steps, I successfully set up and configured Snort IDS, created custom rules, and tested the system to ensure it effectively monitors and alerts on network activities.
